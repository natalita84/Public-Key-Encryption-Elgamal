# Python 3.5

# Steps
1. Open a cmd console
2. Enter the path where the Main.py of each algorithm is saved.
3. Execute next command = python Main.py -m=server -b=bits "bits=1536,2048,3072,4096".
4. Execute next command = python Main.py -m=client -b=bits "bits=1536,2048,3072,4096" -e=message  "message=number"

Note: You can make a database connection, if you don't need it you can comment those lines.
